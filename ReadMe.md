# Advent of Code 2022

I mostly use the following languages:
* Vim: Preprocessing
* OCaml: functional features, simple syntax
* Python: many libraries, easy to use
* Coq: because it is unexpected

I probably will do some of the puzzles in other languages:
* Haskell: functional and lazy evaluation, cool syntax, libraries (probably useful for complicated parsing)
* Rust: fast and interesting to improve knowledge

Note:
My solutions are written right after getting up and without best practices, readability, maintainability, and performance in mind.
